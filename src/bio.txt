Born in Belgrade.

She earned the MBA degree from the University of Belgrade and later went to Italy to be trained in mosaic schools. Countless hours spent in the studio helped her to develop her own style and choose mosaic as the primary medium of her work.

Using ancient mosaic techniques, she tries to harmonize this old tradition with new materials and modern art. The diversity of materials available helps her to express ideas into art, giving an opportunity to experiment more and to balance contrasts between different materials and structures. It makes a powerful tool to communicate ideas, forms, and movement. She prioritizes marble as a medium and considers breaking the marble as an art already, as it is hard to produce two identical pieces. She combines marble tesserae with glass, smalti, shells, gold, ceramic... anything is appropriate if it can add joy to her work, even the object found in nature.

Her work was awarded twice, in 2011 and 2012 by Dubai International Art Centre. In 2016 she was awarded for The Most Inspiring Sculpture by the committee of the Ras Al Khaimah Fine Art Festival. In 2017 she was awarded for the best artworks at the international exhibition “Mosac as Contemporary Art”, held in Belgrade.
She is a member of the International Association of Contemporary Mosaicists(AIMC).

Lives and works in Abu Dhabi.
